## 📜 History
**Lead Architect:** Realm  
**First Release:** February 2026

RealmOS began as a project to outperform standard distributions like Zorin OS Lite and LMDE 7. After extensive virtual machine stress testing, RealmOS demonstrated superior stability and lower resource usage than its competitors.

* **vs. Zorin OS:** RealmOS provides a newer kernel and lighter memory footprint.
* **vs. LMDE 7:** RealmOS utilizes KDE Plasma without the graphical instability found in Cinnamon on legacy drivers.
* **vs. MX Linux:** RealmOS retains the MX tools but refines the UI for a modern, "Cyberpunk" aesthetic.
